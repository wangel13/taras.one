[Apollo Studio](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/) is a cloud platform that helps you build, validate, and secure your organization's graph. It's free service for all Apollo users, you can use it with development or production server. I really enjoy to construct queries in studio visual interface.

For authentication, I use [next-auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) library. Easy, flexible and secure, have built in support for popular auth services. All this code you can find and test in my starter [prisma-next-auth-graphql-starter](https://github.com/wangel13/prisma-next-auth-graphql-starter).

## Just three steps, and you can use studio with authenticated graphql queries and mutations.

First you need to enable sameSite `cookies policy` for `sessionToken`. Do it only in `development mode` for security reasons:

```jsx:/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts
const cookiesPolicy =
  process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
    ? {
        sessionToken: {
          name: `_Secure_next-auth.session-token`,
          options: {
            httpOnly: true,
            sameSite: 'None',
            path: '/',
            secure: true,
          },
        },
      }
    : {}

export default NextAuth({
  secret: process.env.AUTH_SECRET,
  providers: [],
  cookies: cookiesPolicy,
})
```

Second, setup `cors` config for next.js api handler to allow credentials for apollo studio origin:

```jsx:/pages/api/graphql.ts
const corsConfig =
  process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
    ? {
        origin: 'https://studio.apollographql.com',
        allowCredentials: true,
      }
    : {}

export default cors(corsConfig)(handler)
```

Third, enable cookies in apollo studio:

That is it, happy querying!
