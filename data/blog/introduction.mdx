I like to solve complex problems. I apply new technologies when it necessary. If legacy code performs it's task, then it is cheaper not to rewrite it, just let it work.

I have a higher technical degree in the field of microelectronics. I like to create complex and beautiful user-friendly interfaces. Participated in projects from startup to big energocomplex automation system.
